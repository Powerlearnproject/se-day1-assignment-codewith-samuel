#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to design, develop, test and maintain software systems. It combines technical skills, problem-solving and structured processes to create reliable, efficient and scalable software solutions.

In the technology industry, software engineering is critical because it ensures software is developed efficiently, meets user needs and adapts to changing demands. Without software engineering, businesses couldn’t deliver innovative products, maintain competitive edges or ensure the security and performance of digital tools that drive economic and social progress.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The Birth of Structured Programming (1960s): Edsger Dijkstra and others introduced structured programming to replace chaotic "spaghetti code" with organized control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals). This milestone improved code readability and maintainability, laying the foundation for modern software development.                                                    
2. Introduction of the Waterfall Model (1970): Dr. Winston Royce formalized the Waterfall methodology, a sequential approach to software development. It provided a structured framework, marking a shift from ad-hoc coding to a disciplined process, influencing project management in large-scale systems.                                                                         
3. Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001): The Agile Manifesto, authored by 17 software developers, emphasized flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. This shift addressed the limitations of rigid models like Waterfall, enabling faster delivery and adaptability in dynamic industries.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning: Define project goals, scope, resources and timelines to ensure alignment with stakeholders.

2. Requirements Analysis: Gather and document user needs and system specifications to guide development.

3. Design: Create blueprints (e.g., architecture, UI) for how the software will function and look.

4. Implementation (Coding): Write the actual code to build the software based on the design.

5. Testing: Verify the software works as intended, identifying and fixing defects.

6. Deployment: Release the software to users or production environments.

7. Maintenance: Provide ongoing updates, bug fixes, and enhancements to keep the software functional.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall: A linear, sequential approach where each phase (e.g., design, coding, testing) completes before the next begins.
Pros: Clear structure, predictable timelines, easy to manage for fixed requirements.
Cons: Inflexible to changes, late feedback from users.
Scenario: Building a banking system with strict regulatory requirements and well-defined specifications that won’t change mid-project.

Agile: An iterative, flexible approach with short cycles (sprints) focusing on collaboration and incremental delivery.
Pros: Adapts to changes, frequent feedback, faster delivery of usable software.
Cons: Less predictable, requires strong team communication.
Scenario: Developing a startup’s mobile app where features evolve based on user feedback and market trends.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software Developer:
Role: Writes and implements code to build software.
Responsibilities: Translate designs into functional code, debug issues and collaborate with team members to meet requirements.

2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:
Role: Ensures software quality by identifying defects.
Responsibilities: Design and execute test cases, report bugs and verify fixes to ensure the product meets standards.

3. Project Manager:
Role: Oversees the project’s progress and team coordination.
Responsibilities: Plan schedules, manage resources, communicate with stakeholders, and ensure delivery within scope, time, and budget.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
Importance: IDEs streamline coding by providing tools like code editors, debuggers, and auto-completion in one interface, boosting productivity and reducing errors. Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA.                                                                                                                                                                                          
2. Version Control Systems (VCS):
Importance: VCS track changes to code, enable collaboration, and allow reverting to previous versions, ensuring team alignment and code integrity. Examples are: Git (with platforms like GitHub), Subversion (SVN).


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Changing requirements: this happens when the initial needs or goals of a software project shift during development. This could be due to evolving user demands (e.g. a client wants a new feature after seeing a competitor’s product), unclear initial specifications, or external factors like market trends or new regulations.                                               
    Strategy: Use Agile to adapt iteratively and maintain regular client communication.
                                               
2. Bugs and Technical debt: bugs are defects or errors in the code that cause the software to behave unexpectedly—like a login button failing or a calculation returning wrong results. Technical debt refers to shortcuts taken during development (e.g., messy code to meet a deadline) that make future work harder.                                                                Strategy: Prioritize thorough testing and allocate time for refactoring code.

3. Time pressure: this arises from tight deadlines, often set by clients, management, or market demands (e.g., launching before a competitor). A team might need to deliver a website in six weeks, but unexpected bugs or scope changes shrink that window.                                                                                                                        
      Strategy: Break tasks into manageable units and use project management tools (e.g., Jira) to track progress.   



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit Testing: Tests individual components (e.g., functions) to ensure they work correctly. Importance: Catches errors early.
2. Integration Testing: Tests how components work together. Importance: Identifies issues in module interactions.
3. System Testing: Tests the entire system as a whole. Importance: Ensures the software meets overall requirements.
4. Acceptance Testing: Validates the software against user needs, often by end-users. Importance: Confirms the product is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting clear, specific, and well-structured instructions (prompts) to effectively communicate with AI models and elicit useful responses. It’s important because AI models rely on input quality to produce accurate outputs. Well-engineered prompts reduce ambiguity, guide the AI’s reasoning and ensure responses align with user intent, making interactions more efficient and productive.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: "Tell me about software stuff."

Improved Prompt: "Explain the key phases of the Software Development Life Cycle in simple terms."

Why It’s More Effective: The vague prompt lacks focus, leaving the AI to guess the user’s intent. The improved prompt specifies the topic (SDLC), the desired detail (key phases), and the tone (simple terms), ensuring a targeted, relevant response.
